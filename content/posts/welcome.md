However you stumbled upon this blog, I'm happy you landed here! My name's Kellen, and I'm an experienced infrastructure engineer whose passion lies in automation. If you hate [ClickOps](https://www.abbey.io/blog/clickops-is-dead-long-live-iac/), this blog is for you.

My goal is to demonstrate how I approach the often daunting challenge of creating scalable, secure, and fully-automated IaC pipelines and practices. Along the way I'll be diving into technical (and organizational) challenges I've encountered, providing examples of projects I've built, and shamelessly explaining mistakes I've made along the way.

Thanks for reading! And happy coding ðŸš€
